#
# Release preparation script for whisper.cpp.
#
# Bumps the version in CMakeLists.txt on a release candidate branch.
# The branch should then be pushed and a PR created, reviewed, and
# merged. After the PR is merged and the build-cpu workflow has
# completed successfully, the release is finalized by the make-release
# workflow (.github/workflows/make-release.yml), which creates the tag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh [major|minor|patch] [--dry-run]
#
# Example:
#   $ ./scripts/release.sh minor
#
# The script:
# 1. Creates a release candidate branch (whisper-rc-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>)
# 2. Bumps the version in CMakeLists.txt
# 3. Commits the version bump
